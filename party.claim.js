// TODO, totally not done, also need to set up room data strctures

/**
 *
 * First send out a scout, if the scout finds a suitable room then,
 * From its home room the party should request a drop miner and a transporter
 * The transporter's body should be calculated so that it exactly matches the miner's output
 * Then have each do the appropriate thing
 * The transporter should carry back energy to the home room, drop it, then create a request to pick it up.
 *
 * Can probably do this with 1 miner, 1 transport, and 1 builder.  You first need to claim the room with a claimer, but the claimer can be immediately recycled.
