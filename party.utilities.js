// TODO, totally not done, also need to set up room data strctures

// Party module should have the same methods as creep modules except without the 'suggested_body' method.  -- Also include an extra method to detect if the party is disbanded.
// When a party module is created, it should check if Memory.parties exists and create it if it does not.
// Parties should request resources, including spawning, from their home rooms.
// Most parties should start with a scout to know what is needed.

// This file should run all parties, regarless of rooms, and should run shutdown methods when parties are disbanded. -- Just like creep.utilities
// Should also include a method for creating parties.
